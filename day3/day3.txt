Exercise:
write a class with name Person.
it should have three attributes,
    firstName as String
    lastName as String
    age as int

create getters and setters for the above three attributes
implement two more methods
    isTeen() - should return true or false based on the age
    getFullName() - should return first name plus last name.

How to test:
    write another test class with main method. with four test cases.
    use setter methods to set the first name, last name and age 
    
    test case 1: first name empty, last name empty, age = 20
    expected result: full name: empty, isTeen is false

    test case 2: first name Muhammad, last name empty, age = 15
    expected result: full name: Muhammad, isTeen returns true

    test case 3: first name Muhammad, last name Shamsi, age = 15
    expected result: full name: Muhammad Shamsi, isTeen returns true

    test case 4: first name empty, last name Shamsi, age = 40
    expected result: full name: Shamsi, isTeen returns false
